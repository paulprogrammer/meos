# MeOS

## What is this?

MeOS is a project I created only for myself to play with ideas in
operating system design.

I am using the amd64 platform because there's a bunch of tooling
and documentation about it.  Much of the initial code is stolen
from sources around the intertubes.

In the immortal words of Frank N Furter:

> I didn't make it for you, I made it for me!

## Can I help?

I guess, if you want.  I'll review PRs and merge them at my own
discresion.  You'll get credit, if you choose to also update the 
CONTRIBUTORS file.
